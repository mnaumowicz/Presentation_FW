## Slide 32  Build Errors
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Build Errors


---
## Slide 33  Build Error- RC.exe 

<b>Build Error- RC.exe </b>

Because RC.Exe is not found, Error Message:

```bash
   "c:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\bin\x64\rc.exe" 
/Foc:\edkii.svn\Build\NT32IA32\DEBUG_VS2013x86\IA32\MdeModulePkg\Application\HelloWorld\HelloWorld\OUTPUT
\HelloWorldhii.lib 
c:\edkii.svn\Build\NT32IA32\DEBUG_VS2013x86\IA32\MdeModulePkg\Application\HelloWorld\HelloWorld\OUTPUT\He
lloWorldhii.rc
'c:\Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
 
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '"c:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\bin\x64\rc.exe' : return code '0x1'
Stop.

```

Find where the RC.EXE is located on your VS Installation:  


Example (VS 2013):  The RC.exe is located on this machine: <br>
```bash
C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x64
```

Edit `Conf/tools_def.txt` 



---
## Slide 34  Build Error- RC.exe 02
<b>Build Error- RC.exe Cont...</b>

Edit `Conf/tools_def.txt` 
Search for your installation of Visual Studio (2013 or 2015)<br>
Update according to the path for where the RC.EXE is found 

```bash
# Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Professional Edition
DEFINE WINSDK8_BIN       = c:\Program Files\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x86\
DEFINE WINSDK8x86_BIN    = c:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x64
 
# Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Professional Edition
DEFINE WINSDK81_BIN       = c:\Program Files\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x86\
DEFINE WINSDK81x86_BIN    = c:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x64


```

### RC FIX for VS 2017 at command prompt type 

```bash
> Set
```
Then  See what the value of WINSDK10_PREFIX is.  This is probably the problem. 
Search your directory "C:\Program Files (x86)\" for the file rc.exe
The one you want will be in  C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x86
 
 
see below for the define: 
```bash 
  From : DEFINE WINSDK10_BIN       = ENV(WINSDK10_PREFIX)DEF(VS2017_HOST)
  to : DEFINE WINSDK10_BIN       = C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x86
```

## Slide 35  Build Error- C1041 
<b>Build Error: fatal error C1041: </b>
Build Error from fatal error C1041: cannot open program database

This Error is usually because the location you are building is being shared by another application in Windows.  Example: Syncplicity may cause this
<br>

Error Message:

```bash
k:\fw\edk2\MdePkg\Library\BaseLib\LinkedList.c : fatal error C1041: cannot open program 
database 
'k:\fw\edk2\build\nt32ia32\debug_vs2013x86\ia32\mdepkg\library\baselib\baselib\vc120.pdb'; if 
multiple CL.EXE write to the same .PDB file, please use /FS
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 
12.0\Vc\bin\cl.exe"' : return code '0x2'
Stop.

```

<b>Solution:</b>  Try using a Workspace that is not shared
